    <h2>Where the idea came from</h2>
    <p>This idea came from one of the members of the Owolabi Family, Oluwadabira Owolabi.<br>
    He thought it was a good idea to create an academy and started creating right away. <br>"Every opportunity I get I update this website and make it a little better".<br></p>
    <h2>Who is Oluwadabira Owolabi</h2>
    <p>
      Oluwadabira Owolabi is a very inteligent boy who created this website at the age of 10.<br>
      The church he goes to is AGC.<br> The school he goes to is Sidmouth Primary School.<br>He said to his mother one day and said:<br>"Mummy, Everybody deserves an opportunity to learn<br>Anything they want to,they deserve to choose what they want to be. I want to create <br>an academy so that we can give other children the opportunity to learn amazing things <br>that can really help them." Oluwadabira decided this academy would be a christian based <br>one. So he created a google classroom and programmed this website. So he wanted to teach every Thursday and Friday.
